# PlayerTracker

Hello there! Thanks for reading. I was inspired to create an application that mimics allowing a Major League Baseball team track player movement around the league and to help make the best scouting/development of players to build a World Series caliber team. I initially learned about such a analytics tool based off of Ground Control, the Houston Astros' internal business analytics/database.
